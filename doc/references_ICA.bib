   abstract = {<p>We introduce a novel fast algorithm for independent component analysis, which can be used for blind source separation and feature extraction. We show how a neural network learning rule can be transformed into a fixedpoint iteration, which provides an algorithm that is very simple, does not depend on any user-defined parameters, and is fast to converge to the most accurate solution allowed by the data. The algorithm finds, one at a time, all nongaussian independent components, regardless of their probability distributions. The computations can be performed in either batch mode or a semiadaptive manner. The convergence of the algorithm is rigorously proved, and the convergence speed is shown to be cubic. Some comparisons to gradient-based algorithms are made, showing that the new algorithm is usually 10 to 100 times faster, sometimes giving the solution in just a few iterations.</p>},

   abstract = {An independent component analysis (ICA) approach to image sharpening is presented for incoherent imaging through weak atmospheric turbulence. Taking account of the turbulence model a novel data representation scheme is used for the ICA algorithm wherein each selected image frame is treated as a sensor. The proposed concept enables one diffraction limited object image and several images that correspond to atmospheric turbulence patterns to be extracted as separate physical sources. By using an image sharpening metric based on the Laplacian operator, it is shown that the ICA algorithm when applied to experimental data with known ground truth gives better results than obtained by the frame averaging method. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {A fundamental problem in neural network research, as well as in many other disciplines, is finding a suitable representation of multivariate data, i.e. random vectors. For reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original data. In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation. In this paper, we present the basic theory and applications of ICA, and our recent work on the subject. Copyright (C) 2000.},
